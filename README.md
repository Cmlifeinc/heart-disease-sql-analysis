# Heart Disease SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes patient health metrics to explore patterns associated with heart disease using SQL and SQLite.

## Objective
Identify demographic and clinical factors that differ between patients with and without heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized patient-level health data with the following fields:

- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Cholesterol
- Max Heart Rate
- Heart Disease (target variable)

## Tools Used
- SQLite
- SQL
- VS Code

## Key Questions
- How prevalent is heart disease in this dataset?
- How does heart disease vary by age and sex?
- Which health metrics differ most between patients with and without heart disease?
- Can simple threshold-based rules identify higher-risk patients?
